Bryce Thomas is the owner and founder of BPT Architecture. He comes from a pedigree of master builders. His grandfather built and designed many prominent buildings in Knoxville, Tennessee where Bryce was raised. His father, while primarily a business man, continued designing furniture, painting, and sculpting.

Bryce knew from an early age that he was destined to the field of Architecture. He attended the University of Cincinnati where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture. While studying, he worked in professional offices gaining knowledge of the practice of architecture. These assignments lead to unique work experiences including work with world renowned architect, Frank Gehry; prominent historic preservationist, Eean MCNaughton in New Orleans, Louisiana, and corporate giant, SOM, the Architects of One World Trade Center in Manhattan.

He has traveled to four continents and extensively throughout the United States, living in every region, gaining knowledge about each locale.

His love of nature and the broad landscape of the West lead him to settle in Seattle, Washington where he apprenticed with noted Architect, Mark Millett. He completed certification as a construction document technologist as well is a licensed Architect for the state of Washington. He continues to appreciate the diversity, light, and culture of the Pacific Northwest.

BPT Architecture was founded in 1999. He has completed many residential renovations, numerous ground up residences as well as many commercial projects and resolved complex permitting issues. Each project has been uniquely custom tailored to the needs and aesthetic desires of the individual customer with regard to environmental responsibility and fiscal restraints.

The Architectural responses have been a collaboration between the owner, contractor, and BPT through engaged conversations and meetings from concept to fruition. A team of familiar consultants are drawn in as needed.

BPT Architecture is optimistic and forward thinking.
